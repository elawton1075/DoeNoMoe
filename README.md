## Background

There is some matching logic already being used within NameUs, but it seems a good amount matches are based on users looking for matches.
I am confident this could be automated with a high degree of accuracy.

## Goal

There are far to many Missing persons and Unidentified persons, today for cold cases investigation only starts up again with a tip or suggested match.
These suggested matches are submitted by web sleuths who spend countless hours looking for possible matches. 

With the vast data matches are hard to locate. This Project is to utilize Automation and maybe AI to look for matches and submit 
reports to NameUs in the hope of giving people back their identities and their families closure
